## About this project

This project was completed as an assessment for the Principles of Data Analytics module of the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at Atlantic Technological University using the original dataset from the official [GitHub page](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). The Palmer penguins data contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. As part of the analysis, some visualizations were created and several correlations were discovered.


## Use of this project

The project is a helpful guide for beginners in data analysis, demonstrating basic tools for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
