# Analysis of the Palmer penguin dataset

***

## About this project
This project was completed as an assessment for the Principles of Data Analytics module of the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at Atlantic Technological University using the original dataset from the official [GitHub page](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). 

The Palmer penguins data contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. As part of the analysis, some visualizations were created and several correlations were discovered.
## Use of this project

The project is a helpful guide for beginners in data analysis demonstrating basic tools for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.

## Getting started


To get to know my project, please ensure that you have Python and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed. 
I worked on my analysis using **Jupyter Notebook**, but you can use a different editor to open it.

To open my project with **Google colab** you can use the [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Kate-217/principles_of_da/blob/main/penguins.ipynb) that was generated with [Open in Colab](https://openincolab.com/).

It is necessary to install additional modules such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. One of the easiest ways to obtain them is by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
